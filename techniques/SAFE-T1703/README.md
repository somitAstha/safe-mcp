# SAFE-T1703: Tool-Chaining Pivot

## Overview
**Tactic**: Lateral Movement (ATK-TA0008)  
**Technique ID**: SAFE-T1703  
**Severity**: High  
**First Observed**: August 2025 (Research-based analysis)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-17

## Description
Tool-Chaining Pivot refers to an advanced lateral movement technique where attackers compromise a low-privileged MCP tool and then leverage it as a stepping stone to indirectly access or invoke higher-privileged tools within the same MCP ecosystem. This technique exploits the interconnected nature of MCP tool architectures and trust relationships between tools to escalate privileges and expand access without directly compromising the target high-privilege tool.

The attack leverages the fact that MCP tools often have implicit trust relationships and can interact with each other through shared resources, data sources, or through the MCP client's context. Attackers exploit these trust boundaries to perform actions that would normally require direct access to privileged tools, effectively bypassing security controls through a chain of tool interactions.

## Attack Vectors
- **Primary Vector**: Compromising low-privilege tools to gain indirect access to high-privilege functionality
- **Secondary Vectors**: 
  - Tool-to-tool communication exploitation through shared data sources
  - Context inheritance abuse where privileged context flows to compromised tools
  - Resource sharing exploitation between tools with different privilege levels
  - MCP client session hijacking to leverage existing high-privilege tool connections
  - Trust boundary bypasses through tool interaction chains
  - Privilege escalation via tool dependency exploitation

## Technical Details

### Prerequisites
- Initial compromise of at least one low-privilege MCP tool
- Understanding of tool interconnections and trust relationships within the MCP ecosystem
- Knowledge of shared resources or data sources accessible by multiple tools
- Ability to manipulate tool inputs or parameters to trigger interactions with other tools

### Attack Flow
1. **Initial Compromise**: Gain control over a low-privilege MCP tool through existing vulnerabilities (e.g., tool poisoning, injection attacks)
2. **Environment Reconnaissance**: Map tool relationships, shared resources, and privilege boundaries within the MCP ecosystem
3. **Trust Relationship Identification**: Identify tools that trust outputs or data from the compromised tool
4. **Pivot Path Planning**: Plan a sequence of tool interactions that will lead to access to high-privilege functionality
5. **Chain Execution**: Execute the tool chain, using each compromised tool to access the next level of privilege
6. **Target Exploitation**: Use the final pivoted access to perform unauthorized actions with high-privilege tools

### Example Scenario

**Initial Setup:**
```json
// Low-privilege tool (compromised)
{
  "name": "data_reader",
  "description": "Read data from shared database",
  "privileges": ["read_shared_data"],
  "outputs": ["structured_data", "data_summaries"]
}

// High-privilege tool (target)
{
  "name": "admin_executor", 
  "description": "Execute administrative commands",
  "privileges": ["system_admin", "user_management"],
  "inputs": ["validated_commands", "trusted_data_sources"]
}

// Intermediate tool (pivot point)
{
  "name": "data_processor",
  "description": "Process and validate data from multiple sources",
  "privileges": ["data_validation", "command_generation"],
  "trusts": ["data_reader", "other_data_sources"],
  "outputs": ["validated_commands"]
}
```

## Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: High - Enables access to high-privilege data and systems through indirect means
- **Integrity**: High - Allows modification of critical systems and data through privilege escalation
- **Availability**: Medium - Can disrupt services by abusing high-privilege administrative functions
- **Scope**: Network-wide - Tool chains can span multiple systems and administrative domains

## Detection Methods

### Indicators of Compromise (IoCs)
- Unusual tool interaction patterns involving privilege escalation
- Low-privilege tools accessing resources typically used by high-privilege tools
- Anomalous data flows between tools with different privilege levels

## Mitigation Strategies

### Preventive Controls
1. **[SAFE-M-56: Explicit Privilege Boundaries](../../mitigations/SAFE-M-56/README.md)**: Define and enforce explicit privilege boundaries between tools with different access levels
2. **[SAFE-M-57: Tool Interaction Controls](../../mitigations/SAFE-M-57/README.md)**: Implement access controls that govern which tools can interact with each other
